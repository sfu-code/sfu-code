          <p>Although we want to support everyone in their development goals, we don't necessarily have the resources to tutor each individual. However, the internet is overflowing with guides aimed at helping beginners. If you have no development experience, consider trying something like <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/">AWS Educate</a>, or look through the documentation of something you want to learn. Feel free to come meet some other beginners and work through things together.</p>
